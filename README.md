# CS506-FINAL
## Project Description
This project intends to clean, analyze, and produce meaningful visualizations of data concerning housing violations within the City of Boston; it aims to identify and evaluate potential patterns involving building management, characteristics, locality, and the nature of these violations.

## Timeline
**Week 0 (2/11)** - Project outlining/planning  

**Week 1 & 2 (2/15)** - Data preprocessing, drafting code  

**Week 3 & 4 (3/1)** - Drafting, scheduled check-in #1  

**Week 5 & 6 (3/15)** - Data analysis, code optimization  

**Week 7 & 8 (3/29)** - Optimization, scheduled check-in #2  

**Week 9 & 10 (4/5)** - Debugging, visualization clean up  

**Week 11 (4/26)** - Final touches, presentation prep  


## Project Goals
For this project, our primary objective is to understand and identify the main problems regarding Boston's housing compliance. We would like to pursue this objective in the following directions:

**Goal 1:** Find offending patterns in the city by identifying and ranking management companies or individual housing owners with the highest violation frequencies.

**Goal 2:** Determine if certain building characteristics, such as build year and property type, are associated with higher violation rates. 

**Goal 3:** Categorize and quantify the specific types of building complaints from the residents to understand the most prevalent housing violation issues in the city.

Achieving these goals will allow the government to focus on the pain points of the housing issues, effectively increasing the satisfaction level of Boston residents. 


## What Data/How we Collected it
For this project, we will use publicly available datasets provided by the City of Boston. Instead of collecting new data ourselves, we will use the existing city records and combine them to form a single, clean dataset that connects violations to specific properties, owners, and neighborhoods.

The datasets include:

- **Building and Property Violations:** Our primary dataset, containing records of housing and building-related complaints and violations across the city.
- **Public Works Violations:** Additional violation data that provides more context about property-related issues.
- **Property Assessment Data:** Contains details about properties such as parcel IDs, ownership information, building type, and build year.
- **SAM (Street Address Management) Addresses Dataset:** Used to standardize and match addresses across all datasets.
- **Neighborhood Boundaries / SAM Neighborhood Boundaries:** Used to group properties by location and determine which communities are most affected.

We plan to link the datasets together using shared identifiers. Specifically:

- The `sam_id` column in the building violations dataset corresponds to the `sam_address_id` column in the SAM Addresses dataset.
- The `parcel` column in the SAM dataset corresponds to the `PID` column in the Property Assessment dataset, which has information about building ownership.
- This same mapping can also be applied to the Public Works Violations dataset.

Using these relationships, we aim to connect each violation to a specific address, parcel, and property record.
