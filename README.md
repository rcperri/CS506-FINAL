Week 5 & 6 (3/15) - Data analysis, code optimization

Week 7 & 8 (3/29) - Optimization, scheduled check-in #2

Week 9 & 10 (4/5) - Debugging, visualization clean up

Week 11 (4/26) - Final touches, presentation prep



Project Goals:
For this project, our primary objective is to understand and identify the main problems regarding Boston's housing compliance. We would like to pursue this objective in the following directions:

Goal 1: Find offending patterns in the city by identifying and ranking management companies or individual housing owners with the highest violation frequencies.

Goal 2: Determine if certain building characteristics, such as build year and property type, are associated with higher violation rates. 

Goal 3: Categorize and quantify the specific types of building complaints from the residents to understand the most prevalent housing violation issues in the city.

Achieving these goals will allow the government to focus on the pain points of the housing issues, effectively increasing the satisfaction level of Boston residents.
